# DATABASE

## Data Engineer Role
* A data engineer is a professional who designs, develops and maintains the architecture, infrastructure and systems needed to collect, store, process and analyze data.
* The are responsible for building and maintaining databases, data warehouses, data lakes and other data storage solutions. Often they collaborate on optimizing datapiplines for better performance, scalability and data quality.

## Key conecpts of Database Theory
* DATA MODEL. These are abstract reprasentations of how data is stored within database. Common data models include: Relational model, Hierarchical model, Network model, Object-Oriented model.
* RELATIONAL MODEL. This model represents data as table (relations) with rows and columns. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to manipulate and query relational databases.
* NORMALIZATION. The process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing databse into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.
* ACID properties. These properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure the realibility of transactions in a database. They guarantee that even in the face of system failure, data remains consistent and accurate.
* INDEXES. Data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations. They allow quick access to specific rows within a table based on certain columns.
* Query Optimization. Techniques used to enhance the performance of database queries. This involves choosing the best execution plan for a query to minimize response time.
* Transaction Management. The control and management of multiple operations that are executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity.
* Concurrency Control. Techniques to manage multiple users accessing and modifying data simultaneously, ensuring that transactions do not interfere with each other.
* Data Warehousing. The process of collecting, storing, and managing data from various sources to support business intelligence and decision-making.
* Data Mining. Extracting patterns, trends, and useful information from large datasets. It's often used for predictive analysis and identifying hidden insights.
* NoSQL Databases. A class of databases that diverge from the traditional relational model. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and offer high scalability and flexibility.
* Distributed Databases. Databases that are spread across multiple computers or nodes. They enable better performance and fault tolerance but also require careful management of data consistency and distribution.
