### Can you explain the ETL process and its importance in data engineering?
**Extract (E):** In this step, data is extracted from multiple sources, which can include databases, spreadsheets, web services, log files, and more. Extracting data from these sources is crucial because organizations often store data in different formats and locations.          
**Transform (T):** After extraction, data often needs to be cleaned, enriched, and transformed to meet specific requirements. Transformation includes tasks like data cleansing (removing duplicates, handling missing values), data enrichment (adding relevant data), and data formatting (changing data types, aggregating data).        
**Load (L):** Once data is extracted and transformed, it's loaded into a data repository or data warehouse. This is typically a centralized storage system optimized for querying and analysis.
